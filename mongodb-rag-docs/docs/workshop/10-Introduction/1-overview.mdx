# Building RAG Applications with MongoDB Atlas

Welcome to the MongoDB-RAG Workshop! Throughout this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and the mongodb-rag library.

## What You'll Learn

In this workshop, you'll:

1. **Understand RAG fundamentals** - Learn how vector search and LLMs work together
2. **Set up MongoDB Atlas** - Create and configure an Atlas cluster with Vector Search
3. **Generate embeddings** - Transform documents into vector embeddings
4. **Build a complete RAG application** - Develop a full application with document ingestion and search
5. **Implement advanced techniques** - Explore hybrid search, metadata filtering, and chunking strategies
6. **Deploy to production** - Learn best practices for scaling your RAG system

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js
- Familiarity with MongoDB concepts (collections, documents, queries)
- A MongoDB Atlas account (free tier is sufficient)
- An OpenAI API key (or Ollama installed locally)
- Node.js (v16+) installed on your system

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is designed to be completed in sequence, with each section building on the previous ones:

1. **RAG Concepts** - Understanding the fundamental concepts
2. **Setting up MongoDB** - Configuring your Atlas environment
3. **Creating Embeddings** - Generating and storing vector embeddings
4. **Building a RAG App** - Creating a full application
5. **Advanced Techniques** - Improving relevance and performance
6. **Production Deployment** - Scaling and monitoring considerations

## Estimated Time

The complete workshop takes approximately 2-3 hours to complete. Each section is designed to be completed in 20-30 minutes.
