# Introducing the MongoDB-RAG Playground: A Developer's Guide to Vector Search

## üöÄ What is the MongoDB-RAG Playground?

The **MongoDB-RAG Playground** is an interactive UI built directly into the `mongodb-rag` library. Designed to provide developers with a **quick and easy** way to explore **vector search**, the Playground helps users visualize their documents, manage indexes, and run search queries‚Äîall without writing extra code.

Once a developer has set up their MongoDB Atlas cluster and ingested data, they can launch the Playground with a single command:

```sh
npx mongodb-rag playground
```

This command spins up a UI where developers can **view documents**, **manage vector indexes**, and **perform vector searches**, making it a powerful tool for experimentation and debugging.

---

## üîß Getting Started with the Playground

To take full advantage of the Playground, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize MongoDB-RAG
First, install the `mongodb-rag` package if you haven‚Äôt already:

```sh
npm install mongodb-rag dotenv
```

Then, initialize a configuration file:

```sh
npx mongodb-rag init
```

This will generate a `.mongodb-rag.json` file where you can specify your **MongoDB connection string**, database name, and collection name.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ingest Data
Before running vector search, you need to ingest documents. This can be done using:

```sh
npx mongodb-rag ingest --file data.json
```

or by uploading a document directly from the Playground UI.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Vector Search Index
Once the data is loaded, create an **Atlas Vector Search Index** using:

```sh
npx mongodb-rag create-index
```

Alternatively, you can manage indexes from within the Playground UI.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the Playground
With the dataset and vector index in place, start the Playground:

```sh
npx mongodb-rag playground
```

This command launches a **local UI**, allowing you to explore your data in real time.
